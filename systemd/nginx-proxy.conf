# This example file shows how to configure Nginx to proxy requests to EmailEngine
# NB! Replace all occurrences of emailengine.example.com in this file with your actual domain name.

# To setup Nginx, if not installed: `apt-get update && apt-get install nginx`

# Copy this file to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/emailengine.example.com.conf

# Once set up run `nginx -t` as root to check for configuration errors
# If no errors were found run `systemctl reload nginx` as root to enable the updated configuration

server {
    # Set up an HTTPS site with HTTP redirect
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

    # --- Domain name ---
    # Make sure to change the domain name
    server_name emailengine.example.com;

    # --- HTTP ---
    # Redirect all requests against HTTP to HTTPS
    if ($scheme != "https") {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    # --- HTTPS ---
    # Make sure to use valid SSL certificates here, these must exist or Nginx would not start

    # To bootstrap you can generate self signed certificates using the following commands:
    #     sudo openssl req -subj "/CN=emailengine.example.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US" -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem
    #     sudo chmod 0600 privkey.pem
    #     sudo mv privkey.pem /etc/ssl/private/emailengine-privkey.pem
    #     sudo mv fullchain.pem /etc/ssl/certs/emailengine-fullchain.pem

    # Once you have the server running with self signed certs, install https://achme.sh as root and run the following
    # to provision a valid and auto-renewing Let's Encrypt certificate that replaces self-signed certs:
    #     /root/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue --nginx \
    #         -d emailengine.example.com \
    #         --key-file       /etc/ssl/private/emailengine-privkey.pem  \
    #         --fullchain-file /etc/ssl/certs/emailengine-fullchain.pem \
    #         --reloadcmd     "/bin/systemctl reload nginx"

    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/emailengine-privkey.pem;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/emailengine-fullchain.pem;
